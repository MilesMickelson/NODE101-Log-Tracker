# Node101-Log-Tracker
Second project in the Node101 course at San Diego Code School demonstrating how to setup an Express server 
with the addition of using a Morgan logger and body-parser module to keep track of visitor trafficking 
information.

Please feel free to demo the project by taking these steps.. 

1. Clone or fork the repo 
2. $ npm install 
3. $ npm start (which will build and run on local server 3000)
4. Open up your browser to view on localhost 3000

Thank you, Miles Mickelson
